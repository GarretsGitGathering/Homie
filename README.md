# Homie... the home assistant... get it?...

This is me and my friend [ry755](https://github.com/ry755)'s final project for a Python class that we took in highschool.

### The idea

The idea was the create a simple home assistant AI similar to that of Alexa or Siri that could perform very basic tasks
when called upon. The execution and final product that is Homie was a (somewhat) functional home assistant that could play
youtube videos (the audio), tell you the weather, and say things we thought were funny at the time... we were in
highschool so you can imagine what we thought was funny lol.

### NOTICE:

This was before either of us either learned or cared enough about proper comment organization... so it's kind of spaghetti... but it's nice to look back at these things and learn!
